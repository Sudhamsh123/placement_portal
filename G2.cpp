ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement:
You are given an array arr of length n. You can perform the following two types of operations:

Decrement Operation: You can reduce any element of the array by 1. You are allowed to perform this operation at most x times total (not per element).

Zeroing Operation: You can instantly make any element 0. You are allowed to perform this operation at most y times total.

ðŸ§  Goal:
Find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray such that all its elements can be made 0 by applying at most x decrement operations and at most y zeroing operations.
